### Hi there, I'm Josh


I’m a Frontend Engineer based near Denver with over a decade of experience crafting thoughtful, user-focused applications. I love turning real-world complexity into elegant, approachable tools—especially when they help people feel more in control of their lives.

Whether I’m building internal tools in a fast-paced environment or exploring new ideas in my personal time, I care deeply about the **why** behind the work. I'm most alive when I'm designing with empathy, developing with clarity, and learning something new along the way.

- 🌱 Always learning and growing in the ever-evolving tech landscape.
- 🌿 Exploring new technologies like Python, Raspberry Pi, and Arduino.
- 🌟 Turning innovative ideas into real, user-friendly solutions.
- 🤝 Big fan of clear UX, clean code, and cross-functional collaboration.
- 🛠️ Prototyping ideas that blend technology with real human needs.
- 🍕 Collaborating with my team at [@dominos-pizza](https://github.com/dominos-pizza) to develop and enhance internal applications and tools.

> I care about building things that make life a little easier, a little clearer, and a little more human.
